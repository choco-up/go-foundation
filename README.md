# Foundation

This is an enhanced foundation library slightly modified from ArdanLab's API [service repo](https://github.com/ardanlabs/service).

This project aims to provide some extra capabilities on top of ArdanLab's version, particularly with the following support:

1. Redis
2. Amazon SES
3. Google Analytics Auth
